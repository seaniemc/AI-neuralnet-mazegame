**Maze Game**
As part of our fourth year module Artificial Intelligence we were tasked with controlling a maze game's characters using Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks. The game itself is a maze game where you are a Spartan warrior and have to get to a goal node randomly generated on the maze. Also in the maze are two types of spiders. the red spiders are controlled with out and Fuzzy Logic but the black spiders uses the A* search algorithm to hunt you down and try annihilate your character. We also have used other search algorithms to help find your way to the winning pint at the end of the game. 

**Main Character**

Our Main Hero is a Spartan Warrior.<br>

**Black Hunter Spider**

This is our black hunter spider who uses the A*(A-star) algorithm to hunt down the Spartan warrior before he reaches his destination.<br>
**Red Spider**

The Red spiders are threaded and randomly move around the map so the Spartan must avoid them.<br>

**Goal node**

The location which the spartan warrior is trying to get to.<br>

**Winners Prize**

**Algorithms Used**

**A* Search:** is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It is widely used due to its performance and accuracy. <br>

**Beam Search:** is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. Beam search is an optimization of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements. <br>

**BruteForce Search:** is a very general problem-solving technique that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.
