**Maze Game**
As part of our fourth year module Artificial Intelligence we were tasked with controlling a maze game's characters using Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks. The game itself is a maze game where you are a Spartan warrior and have to get to a goal node randomly generated on the maze. Also in the maze are two types of spiders. the red spiders are controlled with out and Fuzzy Logic but the black spiders uses the A* search algorithm to hunt you down and try annihilate your character.
